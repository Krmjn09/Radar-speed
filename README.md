# 🚗 Radar-Based Speed Detection System

Welcome to the **Radar-Based Speed Detection System**! This project is designed to monitor vehicle speeds using a radar sensor integrated with a Raspberry Pi. The system provides real-time feedback on speeding with a visual display and also features a web-based interface for monitoring and analyzing speed data over time.


## 🛠️ Project Overview

This system is an innovative approach to monitoring traffic speeds, utilizing a radar sensor connected to a Raspberry Pi. The system:

- **Displays Emojis**: Shows a happy emoji 😊 when the speed is within limits and an angry emoji 😡 when the speed exceeds the limit.
- **Real-Time Speed Display**: The speed of the detected vehicle is displayed on a screen along with the emoji.
- **Web-Based Monitoring**: A responsive website that fetches and displays speed data for individual days or a selected range of days. It also tracks and displays the number of overspeeding vehicles.


## 🎯 Features

- **Radar Sensor Integration**: Detects vehicle speed in real-time using a radar sensor.
- **Raspberry Pi Processing**: Processes the radar data using a Python script on a Raspberry Pi.
- **Visual Feedback**: Displays appropriate emojis based on whether the detected speed is within the limit.
- **Speed Monitoring Dashboard**: A web interface that allows you to:
  - View speed data for specific days or date ranges.
  - Monitor the number of overspeeding vehicles.
  - Gain insights into traffic patterns.
